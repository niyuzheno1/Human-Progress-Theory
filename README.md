Let alone famous people like Einstein will come to the US and meet people who are also smart.  It’s true that Tesla and other electric cars were invented because of atomic energy. .The truth is that in the 1800s, people were using steam and electricity for everything. Now we have nuclear power, which was also discovered because of atomic energy. It’s not true that modern times wouldn’t exist without atomic energy. .In truth, the only thing that can help us to save the planet is nuclear power. People are now thinking about how they can reduce their carbon footprint.The truth is that only if we have atomic energy, we have power to use electricity.
