# Human-Progress-Theory

This is the unique document over my thought of humanity and dire situation in the world. I came to the conclusion that only through three elements and these elements are an inseparable part of human society, we will improve upon what we have regarding the current situation.

### Introduction: Why do Humans Need Wars to Progress?

I am far from sensationalists to state that human needs war. Only through wars the final simulation of all simulations, people will improve. Remember during the world war two, we have seen that people developed atomic weapons.  The question is, how will people improve? Will we gain more comfort and freedom?Not at all. What do you think? There was a large number of people who died in the world war two. And what if I told you, the war ended due to nuclear weapons that were developed during this period, am I not telling the truth?

The truth is that only if we have atomic energy, we have power to use electricity. We have Tesla and other types of electric cars. If we don’t have world war 2, we might never discover such energy. Let alone famous people like Einstein will come to the US and meet people who are also smart.  It’s true that Tesla and other electric cars were invented because of atomic energy. .The truth is that in the 1800s, people were using steam and electricity for everything. Now we have nuclear power, which was also discovered because of atomic energy. It’s not true that modern times wouldn’t exist without atomic energy. .In truth, the only thing that can help us to save the planet is nuclear power. People are now thinking about how they can reduce their carbon footprint.The truth is that only if we have atomic energy, we have power to use electricity. We have Tesla and other types of electric cars. If we don’t have world war 2,

Let alone war has brought us to a new era of energy. It also opens up new frontier in computing, specifically in the field of large-scale computation. In world war 2, we have witnessed the first computer was invented in the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC. Famous people, like Alan Turing and John von Neumann have contributed to the advancement of computer science since then. In the 1960s, we saw the invention of integrated circuit with transistor in IBM research laboratory in New York. This made it possible for microprocessor to exist as well as smaller, more powerful computers.Despite these technological leaps, computing has remained out-of-reach for many

Now, we have also opened up a new era of warfare, the psychological warfare. People post information online that is far from the truth to make others believe it is the truth. The FBI or the other law enforcement agencies (maybe the DEA) create fake accounts and intercept communication between drug cartel to make sure that they do not get away with their plan. The ISIS has been using social media to broadcast propaganda and recruit new members. There are countless examples of how one can use social media for good or bad purposes. Social Media: It's Not Just a Place to Put Your PicturesIt is evident that the internet has changed our society in ways we cannot yet imagine,
